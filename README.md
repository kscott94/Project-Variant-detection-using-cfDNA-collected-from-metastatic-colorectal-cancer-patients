# GTM-Project

### Project Description

I am reproducing part of the variant analysis from Lim et al. (2021), focusing on Patient 42. Using cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples, I am examining chromosome 17 variantsin mCRC patients across three time points relative to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody (cetuximab) treatment: before treatment, during treatment, and at disease progression. I will focus on mutations in TP53 and ERBB2, two chromosome 17 genes frequently altered in colorectal cancer and included in the study’s targeted sequencing panel.
