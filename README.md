# GTM-Project

### Project Description

I am reproducing part of the variant analysis from Lim *et al.,* 2021 (PMID: 34381078). Using cell-free DNA (cfDNA) samples, I am examining chromosome 17 variants in mCRC patient 42 across three time points (before treatment, during treatment, and at disease progression) in response to anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody treatment (cetuximab). I will focus on mutations in TP53 and ERBB2, two chromosome 17 genes frequently altered in colorectal cancer and included in the study’s targeted sequencing panel.
